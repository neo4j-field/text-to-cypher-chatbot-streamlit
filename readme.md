# Chatbot using Neo4j Database and LangChain

This project implements a chatbot utilizing Neo4j as the underlying database and LangChain classes for prompt engineering. The aim is to create a natural language interface over the graph data stored in Neo4j.

## Components:

### 1. Chatbot Logic:
The main logic of the chatbot is implemented using LangChain classes, which facilitate prompt engineering to interact with the Neo4j graph database.

### 2. Neo4jService Class:
This class contains methods for interacting with the Neo4j database. Additionally, it includes functionalities for logging metadata generated by the Streamlit app into the graph.

## Usage:
To run the chatbot:

1. Create .env file with the following keys

```shell
NEO4J_URI=
NEO4J_DATABASE_NAME=
NEO4J_PASSWORD=
NEO4J_USERNAME=
